Same seed + same choices = identical outcome
Verified across:
- 19 RNG tests
- 100 ChoiceSystem property tests
- 150 BattleSystem property tests

Result: No state bugs, clean flow
```

### Battle System (Production Ready ✅)
```
Turn-based auto-battle
Speed-based initiative
Deterministic targeting (lowest HP)
Damage formula: floor(atk - def/2) + rng(-2, 2), min 1
500 turn limit prevents infinite loops
Draw support for edge cases

Result: 35 tests, all passing
```

### UI/UX (Polished ✅)
```
