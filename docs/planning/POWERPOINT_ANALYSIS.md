## Adaptation Strategy

### Mockup Slide 4 (Battle) Needs Adaptation

**Mockup Shows:**

- Interactive action menu (Attack/Spells/Items/Defend)
- Turn-based player input

**Our Implementation:**

- Auto-battle (no player input)
- Visualize BattleResult.actions as animation sequence
- Show actions happening automatically

**Suggested Adaptation:**

```typescript
// BattleScreen shows combat as automatic sequence
// Each CombatAction from BattleResult plays as animation:

actions.forEach((action, index) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // 1. Highlight attacker
    // 2. Play psynergy GIF
    // 3. Show damage number
    // 4. Update HP bar
    // 5. If defeat, fade out unit
  }, index * 1000); // 1 second per action
});

// When complete, transition to rewards
```

**Pros of Auto-Battle:**

- Simpler implementation
- Faster battles
- Deterministic (matches our engine)
- Good for mobile (no complex input)

**Cons:**

- Less player agency
- Can't use items/spells mid-battle

**Solution:** Keep auto-battle for MVP, add interactive mode post-launch

## Quick Win: Implement Battle Screen

I can build a functional battle screen in 3-4 hours using:

- **Character sprites:** CSS colored blocks (placeholder)
- **Attack animations:** Psynergy GIFs (we have these!)
- **HP bars:** CSS progress bars (Tailwind)
- **Damage numbers:** Animated divs
- **Battle flow:** Sequence through BattleResult.actions

**Result:** Fully playable game loop!

**What would you like me to build first?**

**A) Battle Screen** (3-4 hours) - Visualize combat with psynergy GIFs  
**B) Main Menu** (1 hour) - Entry point for game  
**C) Rewards + Recruit** (4 hours) - Complete the loop  
**D) All of the above** (8-10 hours) - Full UI per mockups  

I have the mockups analyzed and sprites ready - just let me know which direction! üéÆ
