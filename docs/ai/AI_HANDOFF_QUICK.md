# ⚡ AI HANDOFF QUICK REFERENCE

**One-page checklist for daily use. See AI_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md for detailed examples.**

---

## 📋 HANDOFF CHECKLIST

### Architect MUST Provide:
- [ ] Explicit algorithm/formula (not just "calculate X")
- [ ] Exact function signatures
- [ ] Example inputs/outputs
- [ ] Reference existing systems to follow

### Coder MUST Verify Before Coding:
- [ ] Read plan completely
- [ ] Confirm understanding: "I will implement X using Y pattern, correct?"
- [ ] Ask questions if anything unclear
- [ ] Wait for explicit approval

### User MUST Review:
- [ ] Verify approach makes sense
- [ ] Approve explicitly: "Yes, proceed"
- [ ] Don't assume AI will start without approval

## ⚠️ WHEN TO SKIP HANDOFF

### Skip Full Protocol For:
✅ Typo fixes
✅ Comment updates  
✅ Formatting changes
✅ Single-line bug fixes

### Abbreviated Handoff For:
⚠️ Small utility additions
⚠️ Test additions (if pattern clear)

### NEVER Skip For:
🚫 New systems
🚫 Breaking changes
🚫 Complex features

## 🚨 RED FLAGS (Stop & Clarify)

**Architect says:**
- "Make it better" (too vague)
- "Add equipment" (no specifics)
- "Implement X" (no algorithm given)

**Coder should:**
- Stop and ask: "Can you specify the exact approach?"
- Don't proceed until explicit

## 🔄 THE CONFIRMATION LOOP

```
Architect creates plan
    ↓
Coder confirms: "I will do X, Y, Z. Correct?"
    ↓
User approves: "Yes, proceed"
    ↓
Coder implements
```

**Time saved: 30+ minutes per misunderstood task**
