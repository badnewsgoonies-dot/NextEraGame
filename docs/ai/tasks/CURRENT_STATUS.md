## 🎯 Recommended Execution

### **Option A: Wait for Tasks 1 & 2**

1. Let Tasks 1 & 2 complete first
2. Merge their changes
3. Then start Task 3 (visual fixes)
4. Clean workflow, no conflicts

### **Option B: Start Task 3 Now**

1. Send Task 3 to another agent chat
2. Work in parallel with Tasks 1 & 2
3. Merge Task 3 first (less likely to conflict)
4. Then merge Tasks 1 & 2

**I recommend Option A** - wait for gem system and test fixes, then polish visuals.
