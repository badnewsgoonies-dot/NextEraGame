**Session 1:**
```
[Give PRIMARY files]

Task: [Your task here]
```

**Session 2 (same chat):**
```

Task: [Your task here]
```

‚úÖ **No need to re-read docs in same chat!**

---

### **Option B: New Chat, Continuing Work**

Read IN ORDER:
1. IMPLEMENTATION_CODER_ONBOARDING.md
2. AI_HANDOFF_QUICK.md  
3. FRESH_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md ‚Üê CRITICAL for new chats!

This is a NEW chat continuing from Session X.

[Provide context about prior work]

Task: [Your task here]
```

**New Graphics Chat:**
```

Read IN ORDER:
1. GRAPHICS_ONBOARDING.md
2. AI_HANDOFF_QUICK.md
3. FRESH_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md ‚Üê CRITICAL for new chats!

```

---

### **Option C: Chat Interrupted Mid-Task**

**Resume in SAME Chat:**
```
Chat was interrupted. Let's recover.

Read: INTERRUPTION_RECOVERY.md

Then resume where we left off.
```

**Resume in NEW Chat:**
```
Previous chat was interrupted mid-task.

Read IN ORDER:

2. FRESH_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
3. INTERRUPTION_RECOVERY.md

[Describe what was completed vs what's pending]

Let's continue.
```

## üéØ HOW TO ENSURE AIS FOLLOW GUIDELINES

### **Method 1: Explicit Reading (Current Approach)**
```
Read this file: C:\Dev\AiGames\NextEraGame\docs\ai\[FILENAME].md

After reading, confirm:
1. You understand your role
2. You know the patterns to follow
3. You're ready to start
```

‚úÖ **Pro:** AI explicitly reads and confirms  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Con:** Relies on AI actually reading

---

### **Method 2: Self-Enforcing Instructions (Embedded)**

All onboarding docs now have:

**At the TOP:**
```markdown
## üö® CRITICAL: READ THIS ENTIRE FILE FIRST

Before accepting ANY tasks:
- [ ] Read this complete file
- [ ] Understand your role boundaries  
- [ ] Confirm architectural patterns
- [ ] Reply: "I have read [FILENAME] and understand my role"

DO NOT proceed without confirming.
```

**At the BOTTOM:**
```markdown
## ‚úÖ CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

Before starting work, confirm:
"I have read [FILENAME]. I will follow [patterns]. I understand my boundaries."

DO NOT start without explicit confirmation.
```

‚úÖ **Pro:** Self-policing  
‚úÖ **Pro:** Forces AI to acknowledge

---

### **Method 3: Pattern Enforcement (In Code Review)**

When Architect reviews Coder's work, check:

```markdown
Did Coder follow patterns?
- [ ] Result types used?
- [ ] Pure functions (no mutations)?
- [ ] Tests added?
- [ ] TypeScript 0 errors?

If NO ‚Üí Reject and cite IMPLEMENTATION_CODER_ONBOARDING.md ¬ß [Section]
```

‚úÖ **Pro:** Catches violations  
‚úÖ **Pro:** Reinforces learning

---

## üìä CHECKLIST: Starting a New AI Session

### Before Giving Instructions:

- [ ] Decide which AI (Architect, Coder, or Graphics)
- [ ] Find PRIMARY docs for that AI (see table above)
- [ ] Copy appropriate startup script
- [ ] Paste into new chat
- [ ] Wait for AI to confirm reading
- [ ] Verify AI states role and patterns
- [ ] THEN give task

### During Task Execution:

- [ ] AI should reference docs when uncertain
- [ ] AI should cite pattern violations (e.g., "Per IMPLEMENTATION_CODER_ONBOARDING ¬ß Result Types...")
- [ ] AI should confirm understanding before coding

### After Task Completion:

- [ ] Check if patterns followed
- [ ] If violated, cite specific doc section
- [ ] Reinforce correct behavior

---

## üéì TRAINING THE AIs (Over Time)

**First Session:**
```
Read: IMPLEMENTATION_CODER_ONBOARDING.md

Confirm: You will use Result types, pure functions, tests.
```

**Second Session (if pattern violated):**
```
Your code mutated the input array. That violates:
IMPLEMENTATION_CODER_ONBOARDING.md ¬ß Pure Functions

Re-read that section and fix.
```

**Third Session:**
```
[AI naturally follows patterns without prompting]
```

‚úÖ **Result:** AI learns over multiple sessions

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

### **Tip 1: Role Confusion?**
```
Stop. Read: ROLE_IDENTIFICATION.md

Clarify your role before continuing.
```

### **Tip 2: Fresh Session Issues?**
```
Before coding, read: FRESH_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md

Verify branch and dependencies first.
```

### **Tip 3: Task Unclear?**
```
Read: AI_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md

Ask Architect for clarification before starting.
```

### **Tip 4: Need Proven Templates?**
```
Check: CHAT_TEMPLATES.md

Copy structure of similar past tasks.
```

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| AI doing wrong role's work | Give `ROLE_IDENTIFICATION.md` |
| AI not following patterns | Cite specific section in onboarding doc |
| Fresh session can't find files | Give `FRESH_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md` |
| Chat interrupted mid-task | Give `INTERRUPTION_RECOVERY.md` |
| Architect task unclear | Give `AI_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` |
| Need task template | Give `CHAT_TEMPLATES.md` |

---

## üìö SUMMARY

**Core Principle:** Give AI the RIGHT docs for their ROLE at the RIGHT TIME.

**Minimal Setup:**
- Architect: 2 files (onboarding + handoff quick)
- Coder: 2 files (onboarding + handoff quick)
- Graphics: 2 files (onboarding + handoff quick)

**Add when needed:**
- Fresh session: +1 file (protocol)
- Interrupted: +1 file (recovery)
- Reference: +2 files (templates, full handoff)

**Enforcement:**
- AI confirms reading docs
- User checks pattern compliance
- Cite doc sections when violated

**Result:** AIs follow guidelines consistently! ‚úÖ
