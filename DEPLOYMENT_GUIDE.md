# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

Your NextEra game is ready to deploy to Vercel! I've configured everything you need.

## 📋 What I've Set Up

✅ **Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`)
- Optimized build settings
- SPA routing support
- Asset caching headers

✅ **Vite Configuration** (updated `vite.config.ts`)
- Changed output directory to `dist` (Vercel standard)
- Production build target

✅ **Build Tested**
- Production build completed successfully
- Bundle size: ~270KB (gzipped: ~80KB)

✅ **Deployment Script** (`deploy.sh`)
- Automated deployment script
- Includes authentication checks

## 🎯 Quick Deploy (2 Steps)

### **Step 1: Authenticate with Vercel**

```bash
vercel login
```

This will:
1. Open your browser
2. Ask you to log in with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
3. Authenticate the CLI

**First time?** Create a free account at [vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup)

### **Step 2: Deploy**

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

**That's it!** Vercel will give you a URL like:
```
https://nextera-mvp-xyz.vercel.app
```

## 📱 Testing on iPhone

1. **Copy the URL** from the deployment output
2. **Open Safari** on your iPhone
3. **Visit the URL**
4. **Enjoy!** 🎮

### **Bonus: Add to Home Screen**

1. Tap the **Share** button in Safari
2. Scroll and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
3. Name it "NextEra"
4. Now you have a game icon! 📱✨

## 🔄 Future Updates

After your first deployment, updating is super easy:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update game"
git push

# Redeploy
./deploy.sh
```

Or if you link to GitHub (recommended):
```bash
vercel --prod
```

Vercel will auto-detect changes and redeploy!

## 🔗 Link to GitHub (Optional but Recommended)

For automatic deployments on every push:

1. Visit [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click **"Import Project"**
3. Select your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-deploy on every push to main branch

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 Auto-deploy on `git push`
- 🔍 Preview deployments for PRs
- 📊 Build analytics
- 🌍 Global CDN

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Error: No existing credentials**
Run `vercel login` first

### **Error: Build failed**
Make sure you've run `npm install` and `npm run build` locally first

### **Port already in use**
Stop the dev server: `pkill -f vite`

### **Need help?**
Check [Vercel docs](https://vercel.com/docs) or run `vercel help`
